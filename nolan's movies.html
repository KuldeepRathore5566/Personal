    <p>Christopher Nolan's debut feature film, Following, is a black-and-white neo-noir thriller that tells the story of a writer who follows strangers around the streets of London, which leads him into a criminal underworld. The film was made on a small budget and shot on weekends over the course of a year, with Nolan financing it by working on corporate training videos during the week.

        Following is a stylish and suspenseful film that showcases Nolan's ability to create a compelling story with limited resources. The film's non-linear structure and unreliable narrator keep the audience guessing until the very end, and the film's themes of identity, power, and voyeurism would become recurring motifs in Nolan's later films.
        
        While Following may not have had the same impact as some of Nolan's later films, it was a promising debut that hinted at the director's potential to become one of the most innovative and successful filmmakers of his generation.</p>
    <li class="list-style"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/?ref_=tt_sims_tt_i_5">Memento</a></li>

    <img src="http://13movies.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/memento-poster.jpg" alt="memento-poster" width="350px">
    <p>Christopher Nolan's breakthrough film, Memento, is a psychological thriller about a man with anterograde amnesia who is trying to solve the murder of his wife. The film is famous for its non-linear narrative structure, which presents the story in reverse chronological order, with each scene leading back to the previous one.

        Memento is a brilliantly crafted film that challenges the viewer to piece together the puzzle of the story, and to question the nature of memory and truth. The film's protagonist, Leonard, is an unreliable narrator who is constantly manipulating his own memories in order to uncover the truth, and the film's themes of identity, perception, and obsession are explored with intelligence and depth.
        
        Memento features an outstanding performance by Guy Pearce as Leonard, and the film's supporting cast, including Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano, are also excellent. The film's innovative structure and clever storytelling helped to establish Nolan as a director with a unique vision and a willingness to take risks.</p>
    <li class="list-style"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278504/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Insomnia</a></li>

    <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.lcmLmRGOZWUfpIqyIrZ8FAHaK8%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=57dbddbbb901c25849ffd78df19c9f6b82527f803c76a55964d2d49bb8b36790&ipo=images" alt="insomnia-poster" width="350px">
    <p>Insomnia is a crime thriller about a detective from Los Angeles who is sent to a small Alaskan town to investigate the murder of a young girl. The film stars Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank, and features a story that is more straightforward than some of Nolan's other films, but is still filled with tension and moral complexity.

        Insomnia explores the themes of guilt and morality, as Pacino's character, Will Dormer, becomes increasingly desperate to cover up his own mistakes while trying to solve the murder case. Robin Williams gives a surprisingly effective performance as the film's villain, and the cinematography by Wally Pfister captures the bleak beauty of the Alaskan wilderness.
        
        While Insomnia may not be as groundbreaking as some of Nolan's other films, it is a solid and suspenseful thriller that showcases the director's ability to work within the confines of a more traditional genre while still bringing his own unique voice to the material.</p>
